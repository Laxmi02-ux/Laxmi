### 🧠 About Me  
Data driven mind with a creative compass.
I decode data into visual intelligence, merging analytics, storytelling, and strategy into one narrative. As an MBA student specializing in Data Analytics and Visualization, I explore how data can influence decisions, elevate design, and build trust through clarity.

Skilled in Python, SQL, Power BI, and NoSQL, with a grounding in Finance, SEO Analytics, and Business Intelligence. I enjoy designing projects that reflect both analytical depth and aesthetic coherence, where every chart, query, and pixel aligns with a purpose.

Currently expanding my learning into Hadoop, Spark, and cloud ecosystems while crafting meaningful, insight driven projects.
