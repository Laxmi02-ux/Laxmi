# Laxmi 
This repository introduces me — my work, my projects, and my perspective on data.

💫 Laxmi Sharma-
Data Analytics & Visualization | Power BI | Python | SQL | AWS | Big Data Foundations
Transforming intricate datasets into compelling visual stories that help businesses perceive what numbers truly whisper.
With a balance of technical precision and creative analytics, I design dashboards that don’t just inform — they inspire action.

🧠 About Me-
Data-driven mind with a creative compass.
I decode data into visual intelligence, merging analytics, storytelling, and strategy into one narrative. As an MBA student specializing in Data Analytics and Visualization, I explore how data can influence decisions, elevate design, and build trust through clarity.

Skilled in Python, SQL, Power BI, and NoSQL, with a grounding in Finance, SEO Analytics, and Business Intelligence. I enjoy designing projects that reflect both analytical depth and aesthetic coherence, where every chart, query, and pixel aligns with a purpose.

Currently expanding my learning into Hadoop, Spark, and cloud ecosystems while crafting meaningful, insight-driven projects.
